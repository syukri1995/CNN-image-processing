## 2024-05-22 - Color Contrast Accessibility
**Learning:** The brand color `#ff4b4b` used for button backgrounds with white text has a contrast ratio of 3.3:1, which fails WCAG AA standards for normal text (requires 4.5:1). This creates readability issues for visually impaired users.
**Action:** In future design updates, consider darkening the primary button color to at least `#E04040` (or similar) or changing the text color to dark grey to meet accessibility standards. For now, we are prioritizing non-controversial UX improvements.
